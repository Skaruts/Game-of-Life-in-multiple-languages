# Game Of Life in Odin

An implementation of GoL using the simplest algorithm. 

As of the time of this writing, I've tried out [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) for a while, and it has quickly become my favorite language of all time. Simple, straight to the point, clean syntax, and small enough I can remember most of it when stop using it for a little while. 

It's being a pleasure to work with it. Manual memory management has been the bane of my existence, but Odin seems to make it bearable and easier to gradually grasp.

Big thanks to Karl Zylinski on youtube/discord, for helping me understand [how to get rid of memory leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg6qogN8kIE), and for his excelent Odin tutorials.
