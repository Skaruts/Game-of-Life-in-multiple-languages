# Game of Life algorithms writen in Odin / Raylib

###### Note: For information about Odin, check the [my other GoL in Odin](TODO) project.

I wrote this version of Odin GoL following the articles writen by Eric Clippert. I may keep doing it as I feel like it, as a way to practice coding in Odin. (If there are different variations of the same algorithm, it's just my way of keeping in mind alternative ways to do something, for later reference).

You can paint/erase cells with the mouse buttons, pause with `Space`, randomize the board with `R`, clear or fill the grid with `C` or `F`

Eric Clippert's articles are by far the most comprehensive and complete GoL programming guide I ever came across (all algorithms explained, as well as the logical progression between them):
