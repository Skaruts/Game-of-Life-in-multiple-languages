# Game of Life algorithms writen in Odin / Raylib

###### Note: For information about Odin, check [my other GoL in Odin](https://github.com/Skaruts/Game-of-Life-in-multiple-languages/tree/master/Odin/single_file_gol_raylib) project.

I found some articles a few years ago about GoL, written by Eric Clippert (see below), that I've been meaning to code-along with all the way through. After having made my first GoL in Odin, I felt the drive to keep going, so I started following Eric's articles. This version of GoL is where I left off so far. I may keep doing it over time, as I feel like it, but no guarantees. I'm not known for finishing projects.

You can paint/erase cells with the mouse buttons, pause with `Space`, randomize the board with `R`, clear or fill the grid with `C` or `F`

(If there are different variations of the same algorithm, it's just my way of keeping in mind alternative ways to do something (in Odin), for later reference).

### The Articles

Eric Clippert's articles are by far the most comprehensive and complete GoL programming guide I have ever came across. All algorithms explained, as well as the logical progression between them, and how they relate to each other. I strongly recommend.
