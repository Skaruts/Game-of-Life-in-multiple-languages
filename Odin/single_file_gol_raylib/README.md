# Game Of Life in Odin

An implementation of GoL using the simplest algorithm, all in one file.

As of the time of coding this, I had tried out [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) for a little while, and it quickly become my favorite language. It seems to be in all respects what I had been looking for all along: a simple, straight to the point, clean syntax, and small enough language that I can remember most of it when I stop using it for a little while.

It's being a pleasure to work with it, despite that manual memory management has been the bane of my existence (I barely ever used C for that reason). Odin seems to make it bearable and easier to gradually grasp.

Big thanks to Karl Zylinski on youtube/discord, for helping me understand memory stuff I didn't yet understand, how to [really get rid of memory leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg6qogN8kIE), and also for his excelent Odin tutorials that I followed.

Shout out to Rickard Andersson, as well, [whose youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLcTrUhSdlg) have also been of great help for learning Odin.
