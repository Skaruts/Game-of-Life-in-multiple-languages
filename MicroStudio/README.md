# MicroLife (js)

As I was trying out the [MicroStudio](https://microstudio.dev) game engine a while ago, I of course developed a Game of Life in it. You can find the whole project here: https://microstudio.dev/i/Skaruts/microlife_js/

It includes drawing tools, zoom and more. There is no GUI, so you'll need to click the `Doc` tab to learn the hotkeys.

Unfortunately, some of the hotkeys may not work so well on some browsers. E.g., the alt key brings up the menu on Vivaldi. I didn't know this at the time (it worked fine on Brave), and I haven't had the patience to fix it, so far.
